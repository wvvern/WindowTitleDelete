# Windows Titlebar Delete 1.8.9

A mod for Minecraft 1.8.9 that hides the Windows titlebar. You can use this to maximize the game and make the window appear as if it's in fullscreen without entering fullscreen mode (borderless window mode).

- Works only on Windows
- You can use `Windows + Up` key to maximize the game window while the title bar is hidden
